`linux6.17-zen` ([click here](https://github.com/hyduez/void-packages/tree/master/srcpkgs/linux6.17-zen)) is optimized for Ryzen 5 8600G. A Zen 4 and monolithic (Phoenix arch) CPU, with 2 NPUs came from Ryzen AI (XDNA drivers). DDR5 dual-channel too and NVME config. Disabled all debug options, Intel and NUMA disabled. Power-saving is not useful at all because im using a desktop pc, so the power supply is managed by AMD drivers and PSU itself. Everything works, atleast my environment where I use VMs, Waydroid and KVMs.

`mirror.linux.ec/voidlinux` is the mirror I set on /etc/xbps.d/ because I live on Ecuador, so thats all
